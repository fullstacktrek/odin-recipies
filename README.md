This page is an introduction to HTML. It is the first project in The Odin Project's curriculum. It helps to understand the structure of a web page. With it one learns how to use headings, paragraphs, un-ordered and ordered list, links, and images. I chose three of the highest rated 5 ingredient recipies from Allrecipes.com.
